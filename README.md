## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This exercise made me esearch more on different ways of making a responsive webpage and centering a webpage. I found CSS properties like the media queries, display flex, and a whole lot. I also learnt how fonts are added from the web.

Below is a snippet of some codes i learnt:

```css
@media (max-width: 900px){
      .column-1, .column-2, .column-3{
        font-size: 12px;
      }
    }
```

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on more ways of making websites responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - This helped me in making the webpage display flex. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container) - This is an amazing article which helped me center align all items in the flex-box on the webpage. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Example resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This helped me in understanding media querries better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
